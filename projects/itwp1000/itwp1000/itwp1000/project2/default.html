<h2>A Quick Overview</h2>
<p>The Detroit Red Wings are a well known and respected ice hockey team based in Detroit, Michigan. The team is one of the Original Six teams of the National Hockey League and are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the NHL. The team wears a white and red uniform, with the darker of the two uniforms being worn when the team plays at home. As the Red Wings are one of the more established NHL teams, they are known for their dedicated fan base. Detroit is so well known for its hockey team, that the city has gained the name “Hockey Town”, which was made a registered trademark in 1996.
<br>
As of 2011, the Detroit Red Wings had won the most Stanley Cup championships of any NHL franchise based in the United States, and are third overall in total NHL championships. The team played for 40 years in Olympia stadium, but eventually moved to the Joe Louis arena. The arena, which was cutting edge at the time, seats over 20,000 people. Despite its sprawling size and its well known name, the arena is one of the oldest still in use today, and will be replaced by a new arena in the coming years.
