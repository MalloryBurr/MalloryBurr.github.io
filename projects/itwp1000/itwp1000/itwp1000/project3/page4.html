			<p>Hockey is a sport filled to the brim with superstition and tradition. Though some of them are a bit quirky, the sense of mystique and magic is part of what makes the sport so amazing. Below are some of these traditions: </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Engraving names on the Stanley Cup- the Stanley Cup is the most iconic trophy in all of sports. All members of the winning team (players, coaches, management, and staff) are engraved into the silver alloy of the Cup.</li>
			<li>Playoff handshakes- to move on in the playoffs, the teams face off in a best of seven games layout. These games are sometimes savage, with plenty of hits and trips, including the occasional blood loss. Despite the physical aspect of the games, at the end of the series, the teams will line up, remove their gloves, and shake each opposing team member’s hand. This tradition is done without question, and when a player does not partake, it becomes a news story.</li>
			<li>Sudden Death Overtime- if the game is still tied after 3 full periods of play, or 60 minutes, sudden death overtime begins. If either team scores, the game is over, and that team wins. This creates quite a bit of suspense and a lot of work for the players, because the game will continue until someone scores. There is no time limit.</li>
			<li>Playoff beards- the tradition of not shaving during the playoffs is one of the most well known hockey traditions. It began as a superstition that shaving could cause the team to lose, and has evolved into a full-fledged rule. </li>
			<li>Tossing hats- when a player scores three goals in one game, it is known as a “hat trick”. Whenever this happens, there is sure to be a downpour of caps thrown onto the ice. Some players may chose to keep some of the hats, where as some players may donate them to charities. </li>
			<li>Octopi on the ice- it original took eight wins to win the cup during the days of the Original Six teams; a win for each leg of an octopus. This logic spurred a tradition that has carried on for nearly 100 years, of raw octopi being flung frequently onto the ice of a Detroit Red Wings game. This is a Detroit only tradition, and is well loved by Wings’ fans.</li>
			</ul>
