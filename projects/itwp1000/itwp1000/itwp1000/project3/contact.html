		<h2>About the Author</h2>
		<p>
		My name is Mallory, and I have lived in the same house in St. Clair Shores my entire life. I attended Lake Shore high school in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. I completed three AP classes between my junior and senior years, and was dual enrolled at Macomb Community college senior year. I had a 3.6 GPA throughout high school, and was an active member in extra circulars. I was a member of the National Honor Society, National Society of High School Scholars, Key Club, Debate Club, and Science Olympiad.
		<br>I took three web design classes in high school, two of them being advanced web design. I placed second in a web design contest my junior year, and was awarded $250. Web design was what sparked my love of computers, and propelled me towards a computer science degree, which I am currently pursuing at Macomb Community College, with a plan to transfer to Wayne State.
