      <h2>Part 6</h2>
	  
		<h3>Part 6a</h3>
		None of the information returned seems to be accurate, and it looks like it's mostly the same
		
		<h3>Part 6b</h3>
		The properties that are consistently different are the specifications after the appVersion and userAgent properties
		
		<h3>Part 6c</h3>
		I don't see these properties as being very useful because they do not seem to be very accurate.
		The property that I think would be the most useful would be those that determine conectivity.
