<h2>Players in the Hall of Fame Who Were Tigers</h2>

The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York honors individuals who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving the sport, and is the central point for the study of the history of baseball in the United States and beyond, displaying baseball-related artifacts and exhibits. Elections of worthy individuals to be honored by induction into the hall of fame commenced in 1936, although the first induction ceremonies were not held until the hall opened in 1939. Through the elections for 2017, a total of 319 people have been inducted, including 220 former major league players, 32 executives, 35 Negro League players and executives, 22 managers, and 10 umpires. Each is listed showing his primary position; that is, the position or role in which the player made his greatest contribution to baseball according to the Hall of Fame
